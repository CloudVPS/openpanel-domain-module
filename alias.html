<p>
By adding an <b>alias</b> domain, you can couple extra domains &mdash; like
the .net and .org with the same name as your existing .com &mdash; to the same
websites and email-addresses, making all domains functionally equivalent.
Please note that this behavior does not yet propagate automatically if you
add aliases after you created other objects.
